# About

**Victor** is a simple markdown editor that is inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  
As a noob in computer science, I start this project to improve myself at my sophomore winter vacation.  
While this is just a project for fun and learning, if you're interested, you can still download it to take a look.  
I would greatly appreciate any feedback.
