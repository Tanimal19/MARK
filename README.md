# About

**Mark** is a simple markdown editor that is inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)  
As a computer science student, I started this project to improve myself during my sophomore winter vacation.  
While this is just a project for fun and learning, if you're interested, you can still download it to take a look.  
I would greatly appreciate any feedback.
