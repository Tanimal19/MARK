As a noob in computer science, I start this project to improve myself at my sophomore winter vacation.  
Since it just a project for fun, I'm not going to release it for other to use.
  
**Victor** is a simple markdown editor that aim to allow user to write and modify their markdown with voice commands,  
which is helpful when you want a snack but don't want to dirty your keyboard.  
By the way, **Victor** is the combination of **voice** and **editor** (very intuitive).
